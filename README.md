## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as a sentence, paragraph, or document. It involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify the subjective information within the text as positive, negative, or neutral.<br><br>
The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the overall sentiment or attitude conveyed by the author or speaker. By analyzing the sentiment of text data, businesses and organizations can gain insights into public opinion, customer feedback, social media discussions, and other forms of textual data.

### <strong>Let's say we have a product review from a customer:</strong>

"Absolutely loved the new smartphone! The camera quality is outstanding, and the battery life is impressive. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. Highly recommended!"

In this case, sentiment analysis would analyze the text and determine the sentiment expressed by the customer. The analysis would likely classify this review as positive because the customer expresses satisfaction and enthusiasm about various aspects of the smartphone.

The sentiment analysis model would analyze the words and phrases used in the text, such as "loved," "outstanding," "impressive," "intuitive," and "highly recommended." These positive sentiment indicators would contribute to the overall positive sentiment classification of the review.

The output of the sentiment analysis could be a sentiment score or a binary classification (positive, negative, or neutral). In this example, the sentiment analysis would classify the review as positive, indicating that the customer had a positive experience with the smartphone.
