## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as a sentence, paragraph, or document. It involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify the subjective information within the text as positive, negative, or neutral.<br><br>
The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the overall sentiment or attitude conveyed by the author or speaker. By analyzing the sentiment of text data, businesses and organizations can gain insights into public opinion, customer feedback, social media discussions, and other forms of textual data.
